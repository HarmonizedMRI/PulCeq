Functions for simulating and checking a 'Ceq' sequence representation on GE hardware.

Units used here is a mix of Pulseq and GE conventions, and are as follows:
```
RF:                  Gauss (typical GE hardware limit is 0.25 G)
Gradients:           Gauss/cm    
Slew rate:           Gauss/cm/ms
Times:               sec
gyromagnetic ratio:  Hz/Gauss  (4257.6 Hz/Gauss for 1H)
```
